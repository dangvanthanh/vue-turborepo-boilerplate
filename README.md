# Vue Turborepo Boilerplate

> Starter template or boilerplate using Vue 3, Turborepo and Vite 

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [bun](https://bun.sh) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web` - Vue 3 app with port is `3000`
- `lib` - Adapter for 3rd party
- `biome-config` - Biome config for the repo
- `typescript-config` - TypeScript config for the repo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Biomejs](https://biomejs.dev) for code linting and formatting
- [Shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com) - Beautifully designed components

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
$ bun run build
````

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
$ bun run dev
````

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to
 share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```bash
$ npx turbo login
````

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
$ npx turbo link
````
